# Football Match Predictor

The **Football Match Predictor** is a Python-based application designed to predict the outcomes of football matches using machine learning techniques. This program analyzes historical match data, team statistics, and other relevant features to provide predictions for upcoming games.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares raw football match data for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Neural Networks for prediction.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows users to tweak model parameters for better accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple interface for users to input match details and view predictions.
- **Visualization**: Displays insights and trends using graphs and charts.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the program:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Football-Match-Predictor.git
   cd Football-Match-Predictor
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download Dataset**:
   Ensure you have the necessary football match datasets. Place them in the `data/` directory.

5. **Run the Program**:
   Execute the main script to start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the program and follow the prompts to input match details or load datasets.
2. Train the model using the provided data or use a pre-trained model.
3. View predictions and analyze the results.
